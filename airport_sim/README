The zipped tarball contains my submission for Assignment #3.
It has three folders (doc, src, and run) in the tarball.
The source codes are located in the "src" folder.
The report in PDF format is located in the "doc" folder.
The script for running the simulation in batch mode on Jinx
cluster is located in the "run" folder.

The following steps are necessary for compiling and running the
distributed airport system simulation.

(1) Install JVM and Java Compiler
(2) Install OpenMPI with Java Interface Support
(3) Compile Distributed Airport System Simulation with mpijavac
(4) Run the Simulation with mpirun

Interactive run command:
mpirun -np 1 java AirportSim 64 (for sequential execution with 64 airports)
mpirun -np 64 java AirportSim 64 1 (for distributed execution using null message with 64 airports)
mpirun -np 64 java Airport 64 2 (for distributed execution using YAWNS with 64 airports)

Script for batch job submission on Jinx cluster (from attached pbs.sh file):
#PBS -q class
#PBS -l nodes=6:sixcore
#PBS -l walltime=00:15:00
#PBS -N hw3
OMPI_MCA_mpi_yield_when_idle=0
/nethome/raliehyaei3/bin/mpirun --hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE -np 64 /nethome/raliehyaei3/jre8/bin/java -cp /nethome/raliehyaei3/openmpi-2.0.2/examples AirportSim 64 1;
/nethome/raliehyaei3/bin/mpirun --hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE -np 64 /nethome/raliehyaei3/jre8/bin/java -cp /nethome/raliehyaei3/openmpi-2.0.2/examples AirportSim 64 2;
/nethome/raliehyaei3/bin/mpirun --hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE -np 1 /nethome/raliehyaei3/jre8/bin/java -cp /nethome/raliehyaei3/openmpi-2.0.2/examples AirportSim 64;

NOTE: The paths in the batch script above must be changed to 
match the locations of your (local) installation of the JVM, 
the OpenMPI with Java Interface Support, and the class files 
from compilation of Java source codes for the simulator.
